# Contributing to Liora Network

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Liora Network! This document provides guidelines for contributing to our experimental research project focused on AI agent coordination.

## Project Status

**⚠️ Important**: Liora Network is currently in an early research and design phase. This is not a production system, and we make no guarantees about stability or feature completeness. We prioritize learning and exploration over shipping working software.

## What We're Looking For

We welcome contributions in the following areas:

### Research and Design
- **Architecture Feedback**: Suggestions for improving our coordination concepts
- **Collaboration Patterns**: New ideas for agent-to-agent interaction
- **Use Case Analysis**: Real-world scenarios where coordination might be valuable
- **Performance Research**: Theoretical analysis of coordination efficiency

### Documentation
- **Concept Clarification**: Making our ideas clearer and more accessible
- **Example Improvements**: Better examples and use cases
- **Implementation Guides**: How-to guides for potential implementers
- **Research References**: Links to relevant academic work and industry practices

### Technical Exploration
- **Prototype Development**: Minimal proof-of-concept implementations
- **Simulation Models**: Tools to test coordination patterns
- **Benchmarking**: Ways to measure coordination effectiveness
- **Security Analysis**: Security implications of coordination systems

## How to Contribute

### 1. Start with Discussion
Before making changes, we encourage opening an issue to discuss:
- What you're planning to contribute
- How it fits with our research goals
- Any concerns or questions you have

This helps ensure your contribution aligns with our experimental direction.

### 2. Contribution Types

#### Documentation Improvements
- Fix typos or unclear explanations
- Add clarifications to complex concepts
- Improve examples and use cases
- Expand on missing details

#### Design Suggestions
- Propose alternative coordination patterns
- Suggest improvements to our architecture
- Share relevant research or industry practices
- Discuss potential implementation approaches

#### Research Contributions
- Analyze the viability of our concepts
- Identify missing considerations
- Provide empirical data or theoretical analysis
- Suggest new research directions

#### Code Examples
- **Small Examples**: Minimal proof-of-concept implementations
- **Simulation Tools**: Code that demonstrates coordination patterns
- **Testing Frameworks**: Ways to validate coordination concepts
- **Integration Examples**: How coordination might work with existing systems

### 3. Contribution Process

1. **Fork the Repository**: Create your own fork of the project
2. **Create a Branch**: Use descriptive branch names (e.g., `docs/improve-agent-lifecycle`)
3. **Make Changes**: Focus on one contribution type per pull request
4. **Document Your Changes**: Explain what you're changing and why
5. **Test if Applicable**: Ensure any code examples actually work
6. **Submit Pull Request**: Include a clear description of your contribution

### 4. Contribution Guidelines

#### For Documentation
- **Clarity Over Completeness**: Prefer clear explanations over exhaustive coverage
- **Honest About Status**: Clearly indicate what's implemented vs. conceptual
- **Use Examples**: Concrete examples help illustrate abstract concepts
- **Avoid Marketing Language**: Focus on technical accuracy over hype

#### For Design Suggestions
- **Explain Rationale**: Why you think your suggestion improves things
- **Consider Trade-offs**: Acknowledge potential downsides
- **Reference Real World**: Connect to actual systems or research when possible
- **Be Open to Discussion**: Expect feedback and be willing to iterate

#### For Code Contributions
- **Keep It Simple**: Prefer clarity over cleverness
- **Include Comments**: Explain what the code demonstrates
- **Make It Run**: Ensure examples actually execute without errors
- **Document Dependencies**: What tools or libraries are needed

## Areas Where We Need Help

### High Priority
- **Security Analysis**: How to secure multi-agent coordination
- **Performance Research**: Theoretical analysis of coordination overhead
- **Use Case Validation**: Real problems where coordination helps
- **Scalability Studies**: How coordination scales with agent count

### Medium Priority
- **Integration Patterns**: How coordination fits with existing tools
- **Monitoring and Debugging**: How to observe coordination in action
- **Resource Management**: Efficient allocation in multi-agent systems
- **Error Handling**: Robust failure modes and recovery

### Research Areas
- **Consensus Mechanisms**: How agents agree on decisions
- **Communication Protocols**: Efficient information sharing
- **Identity and Trust**: Managing agent reputation and verification
- **Learning Systems**: How coordination patterns improve over time

## Code of Conduct

We strive to maintain a welcoming and constructive environment:

- **Be Respectful**: Disagree with ideas, not people
- **Stay Constructive**: Focus on improving the project
- **Be Patient**: Remember we're all learning together
- **Ask Questions**: No question is too basic if it helps understanding
- **Share Knowledge**: Help others understand complex concepts

## Getting Help

### For Questions
- **Open an Issue**: For detailed questions or discussions
- **Use Discussions**: For general conversation about the project
- **Be Specific**: Provide context and examples when asking for help

### For Technical Help
- **Check Documentation**: Start with our docs/ directory
- **Review Examples**: Look at examples/ for implementation patterns
- **Ask for Clarification**: Don't hesitate to ask for help understanding concepts

## Experimental Nature

### What This Means for Contributors

**Transparency**: We clearly distinguish between:
- ✅ **Implemented**: Actually working code
- 🔬 **Conceptual**: Design ideas and patterns
- 🚧 **Planned**: Intended future work
- ❓ **Unknown**: Open questions requiring research

**Flexibility**: We may change direction based on:
- New research findings
- Community feedback
- Technical discoveries
- Real-world validation results

**Learning Focus**: Success is measured by:
- Insight generation
- Concept refinement
- Knowledge sharing
- Research progress

### What We Don't Promise

- **Production Readiness**: This is research, not a product
- **Feature Completeness**: Concepts may never be fully implemented
- **API Stability**: Interfaces may change as we learn
- **Timeline Commitments**: Research pace is unpredictable
